### 4. First Simulated Ticket ‚Äî Add Local User via `lusrmgr.msc`

After completing the osTicket installation, I created my first ticket simulating a real-world Tier 1 help desk scenario.

#### üßæ Ticket: Add Local User via `lusrmgr.msc`

**Ticket ID:** TICKET-001  
**Issue Summary:**  
Create a new local user account on a Windows 11 system.

**Steps Taken:**  
1. Opened the Run dialog using `Win + R`.  
2. Entered `lusrmgr.msc` to launch Local Users and Groups Manager.  
3. Navigated to `Users` ‚Üí Right-clicked ‚Üí `New User...`.  
4. Filled in details:  
   - Username: `diego.intern`  
   - Full Name: `Diego Rivera`  
   - Temporary Password: `TempP@ss123`  
5. Deselected "User must change password at next logon" for test purposes.  
6. Clicked ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù and confirmed user `diego.intern` appeared.

**Resolution:**  
User account successfully added and verified on the Windows system.

**Lessons Learned:**  
This method is ideal for Windows Pro editions. For Home editions, you can use `net user` via CMD.

### 5. Simulated Ticket ‚Äî Computer Won‚Äôt Power On

**Ticket ID:** TICKET-002  
**Issue Summary:**  
User reports their desktop PC will not power on when pressing the power button.

**Steps Taken:**  
- Confirmed outlet is working by testing another device  
- Checked power cable ‚Äî was loosely connected to PSU  
- Reseated cable and system powered on  
- No signs of hardware failure

**Resolution:**  
Reconnected loose power cable. System powered on successfully.

**Lessons Learned:**  
Start with simple, non-invasive checks ‚Äî loose cables are a common issue. Document all steps, even if the solution is quick.

### 6. Simulated Ticket ‚Äî Add User to Ubuntu Server

**Ticket ID:** TICKET-006  
**Issue Summary:**  
User requested the creation of a new standard Linux account (`sierra.contractor`) on the Ubuntu server for SFTP access. No administrative privileges required.

**Steps Taken:**  
- SSH‚Äôd into Ubuntu server as admin  
- Verified the user account didn‚Äôt already exist: `id sierra.contractor`  
- Created the user with: `sudo adduser sierra.contractor`  
  - Set temporary password  
  - Filled optional fields (Name, Room, etc.)  
- Verified account presence: `getent passwd sierra.contractor`  
- Checked shell and home directory: `grep sierra.contractor /etc/passwd`  
- Confirmed no sudo privileges: `sudo -l -U sierra.contractor`

**Resolution:**  
New user `sierra.contractor` created successfully with standard privileges and no sudo access.

**Lessons Learned:**  
Always confirm account creation with system commands. Validate access rights to avoid privilege escalation. A secure SFTP user setup is critical for access-limited workflows.

- **Technical Troubleshooting**  
  Learned how to methodically diagnose and resolve hardware, software, and access issues across Windows and Linux environments.

- **Documentation & Ticketing**  
  Practiced structured issue documentation and professional communication using a real ticketing platform (osTicket), simulating workplace expectations.

- **System Administration Basics**  
  Created and managed local user accounts, verified access permissions, and used commands like `adduser`, `getent`, and `lusrmgr.msc` to simulate real admin tasks.

- **Environment Setup & Tooling**  
  Installed and configured Apache, MySQL, PHP, and osTicket in a LAMP stack ‚Äî reinforcing package management and system configuration.

- **Soft Skills**  
  Wrote user-friendly responses, followed up on issues, and practiced concise technical writing for clarity and empathy.

This project strengthened my confidence in supporting real users and prepared me for entry-level IT roles with practical, demonstrable skills.
